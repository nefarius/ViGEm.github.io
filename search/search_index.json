Over time many aftermarket and just blatant ripoff devices have appeared on the market, primarily aiming for compatibility with the original PlayStation 3 platform. It's even been observed, that official Sony gear can behave differently on platforms other than the PlayStation, most probably due to slight changes in both controller and PlayStation firmware.</p> <p>While this project has been designed with highest compatibility towards cheaper and aftermarket devices in mind it is impossible to support them all with the same level of quality the legit hardware delivers. Some chips used by aftermarket/ripoff/fake controllers behave differently to variations in certain Bluetooth properties not always possible to influence on Windows, some are timing sensitive and fail if packets don't arrive exactly as engineered for the PlayStation 3. Some simply refuse to connect at all despite many other devices working flawlessly. That's just how it is and will most probably not change in the near future.</p> <p>I encourage any user to test this solution with their hardware, yet keep in mind, that \"my BlyatShock 3.5 from VeryLowPriceStore LLC. doesn't work\" issue reports will be discarded without further comment. It is simply not my desire nor my job to fix other el cheapo manufacturers broken firmware.

By default, the profile that comes with DS4Windows called... Default... is set to emulate a Xbox 360 controller. You can create new profiles with different settings to best fit your use case, though this section will focus solely on creating a profile with DS4 emulation:</p> <ul> <li>Go to the Profiles tab</li> <li>Click on the \"New\" button to create a new profile</li> <li>When asked if a preset is to be used, choose \"yes\"</li> <li>Select <code>Gamepad</code> and then <code>DualShock 4</code> at the Output Controller</li> <li>Adjust the Light Bar color to what you desire acordingly to the Light Bar to LEDs translation section (in the example below the profile will be represented by LED 2)</li> <li>Give a name to your profile (e.g.: DS3 to DS4)</li> <li>Save the profile</li> <li>Back in the Controllers tab, click on the Selected profile box and change from default to the profile you just created </li> </ul> <p>And done, now you can switch between XInput/DS4 emulation by changing between profiles.</p> <p>Keep in mind that some games that support DS4 controllers use the <code>Touch Pad</code> for options/to open the map/etc. In this case, you'll need to remap a button as the <code>Touch Pad</code> button on a new profile to use it.</p> Do I need to use HidHide or the \"hide ds4 controllers\" option to hide my DS3 controller in order to prevent the \"double controller\" issue? <p>No need to. The \"real\" part of the DS3 controller in DsHidMini's DS4Windows Mode can only be recognized by DS4Windows and is therefore already imune to the \"double controller\" or \"double input\" issue. Games will only be able to detect the DS3's emulated/virtual Xbox 360/DS4 counterpart.</p> Select button is not recognized in some games when emulating a DS4 / How do I use the Touch Pad button? <p>A DS3 controller has 13 buttons while a real DS4 controller has 14, this extra button being the <code>Touch Pad</code> button which can't be mapped directly to the DS3 by DsHidMini.</p> <p>Some games that support DS4 controllers use the <code>Touch Pad</code> for options, opening the map, etc. To work around this, the user needs to remap an existing button to the <code>TP</code> one. </p> <p>Usually, games that use the <code>TP</code> button don't use the <code>Share</code> button (the default <code>Select</code>), so the usual bet is to remap it to the <code>TP</code>, though any other one can be chosen. So, after creating a profile with <code>DS4</code> emulation:</p> <ul> <li>Duplicate your DS4 profile, choose a different name to it</li> <li>Edit the new profile</li> <li>On the left side, in the DualShock 4 picture, click on the button you want to remap</li> <li>On the new window that appears, select the middle of the Touch Pad</li> <li>Save your profile and switch to it</li> </ul> <p>If a game uses both the <code>Share</code> and <code>TP</code> buttons, you can have a profile with <code>Share</code> as it is and the <code>PS</code> button remapped to the <code>TP</code>. Or, if you want more advanced solutions, you can use <code>special actions</code> in the profile settings so you can switch between different profiles by button combinations mid-game.</p> Steam/Some emulator or app doesn't detect my controller when emulating a DS4, only when emulating a Xbox 360 <p>Steam and some other apps/emulators (Yuzu/CEMU) will fully ignore DS4 controllers, real or virtual, if they detect that DS4Windows is running. This happens as their own means of preventing the \"double controller\" issue, which is not a problem for DS3 controllers being used with DS4Windows.</p> <p>To workaround this detection and make those apps stop ignoring the DS4 controller, DS4Windows needs to be running under a custom \".exe\" name.</p> <p>Some remarks regarding Steam</p> <ul> <li>Regarding most Steam games, 99% of the games that support DS4 controllers should detect the emulated one as normal regardless if Steam itself is not</li> <li>If using a custom \".exe\" name it's also recommended to DISABLE Steam's \"Playstation Configuration Support\", in its controller settings, so Steam doesn't remap your controller again along DS4Windows</li> <li>A custom \".exe\" name must be used with DS4W for the emulated DS4 to interact with Steam's Big Picture Mode<ul> <li>But the \"Playstation Configuration Support\" option doesn't need to be enabled for this</li> </ul> </li> </ul> 'X' game does not detect my emulated DS4 / my game is not showing PS button icons <ul> <li>First, double check if the game actually supports DS4 controllers and has native PS icons when played with a DualShock 4. There is no direct way to check this besides just testing, Googling around and looking at forums</li> <li>If the game does not support DualShock 4/PS icons then that's in no way related to us and we can't do anything about it</li> <li>If you are 100% sure the game supports PS button icons/DualShock 4, then it may be detecting that DS4Windows is running and then ignoring DS4 controllers (super rare case, only 1 game is known to do it). Check the topic above on how to solve this</li> <li>If the game still doesn't recognize the emulated DualShock 4 then we have no idea what's going on and you are welcome on reaching us through the proper means</li> </ul> How do I do 'X' thing on DS4Windows? <p>DS4Windows is a really amazing tool that can do lots of things, but the purpose of this guide isn't covering DS4Windows in itself, it's to give users the minimum necessary to have XInput/DS4 emulation and to cover DsHidMini related functions, like Light Bar color to LEDs translation.

Yes, we've got HidHide integration but that project has its own weaknesses (simply due to how device stacks operate in Windows) which can't really be addressed unless you consider a serious redesign or extension of the existing design. We were reminded on how SCP shipped around that: by brute-force just completely replacing the function driver of the device with WinUSB. This approach is not a simple undertaking, especially if you support more than one device you didn't manufacture and have no control over its firmware or driver packages. While there are automated solutions available to on-the-fly craft custom driver packages (INF file for WinUSB and self-signed catalogue file) they are in danger of becoming obsolete with tightening restrictions on driver signatures in future versions of Windows. Hot-swapping drivers of HID devices is always a gamble simply due to the fact that most will have open handles during their lifetime and the unloading of the current driver may simple be not possible without a reboot.</p> <p>But then I remembered a product that actually could pull off runtime driver swapping for quite some time with ease: VMware Workstations USB pass-through feature! For those who do not know: VMware Workstation on Windows (potentially other OS'es, haven't checked) can \"mount\" USB devices into the Virtual Machine where it is then exclusively available for said machine. The switch from host (the system running Workstation) to guest (the Virtual Machine) and vice versa typically only takes a second or two and is a nice seamless experience. So what we were after was definitely possible, just needed to figure out how VMware does it and model a new filter driver after it! Easy, right?</p>"},{"location":"projects/Identinator/#how","title":"How","text":"<p>Let's start with understanding how VMware pulls off the smooth transition from host to VM. First the device of interest needs to be \"hidden\" from the host machine since only one system at a time is allowed to have authority over said device and send requests to it. This is achieved by swapping the primary (function) driver from whatever default to <code>vmusb.sys</code> (similar to <code>WinUSB.sys</code>), effectively handing over control to VMware's processes. Now VMware tools can spawn a virtual replica of the USB device within the VM and traffic to (and from) this device will be passed to the real physical device on the host. Sounds simple enough, right? Well, in reality we face a few problems. Most USB devices (predominantly HID devices) can not hot-swap their function driver because of open handles and other drivers higher up in the stack, so after wasting a couple of seconds this procedure would most probably error out because the driver swap and necessary device restart couldn't finish successfully during runtime. So we need to pull another trick which restarts the device and somehow alters it in a way which causes the PnP subsystem into loading <code>vmusb.sys</code> instead.</p> <p>Another driver enters the scene: <code>vmci.sys</code>. This one acts as a bus filter driver for USB host controllers and hubs and does something very smart. When instructed by VMware's processes, it swaps the Hardware ID of the USB device from whatever original value to <code>USB\\Vid_0E0F&amp;Pid_0001</code> and power-cycles (port reset) the device which causes <code>vmusb.sys</code> to load onto it. <code>vmci.sys</code> intercepts IRP_MJ_PNP requests made to the USB bus and alters the reported hardware ID string, therefore causing the PnP manager to look for the custom function driver instead. To pull the swap off in seconds the following sequence happens:</p> <ul> <li>User chose device (e.g. a USB joystick) to get forwarded into VM</li> <li><code>vmci.sys</code> gets instructed to power-cycle the joystick by sending a port reset to the parent hub device</li> <li>USB devices are \"surprise removal\" capable, meaning they have to expect to be unplugged at anytime, a port reset is basically a quick \"reboot\" of the device</li> <li>When the device comes online this time <code>vmci.sys</code> alters the hardware ID to <code>USB\\Vid_0E0F&amp;Pid_0001</code> which causes Windows to match and load <code>vmusb.sys</code> as the new function driver</li> <li>Now that <code>vmusb.sys</code> is in charge of our joystick, packets can be exchanged with the VM and the host system can no longer \"see\" a joystick but a custom vendor-defined USB device</li> </ul> <p>The same trick is pulled off by Identinator by utilizing the <code>nssidswap.sys</code> bus filter driver which basically performs a subset of tasks like <code>vmci.sys</code> and rewrites Device ID, Hardware ID(s) and Compatible ID(s) in a way that the OS-shipped <code>WinUSB.sys</code> gets loaded instead of the original function driver.</p> <p>With these quick-switch capabilities we're now able to switch to and from WinUSB during runtime without any delay or locked devices and communicate with the device directly in our software!</p>"},{"location":"projects/Identinator/#ui-overview","title":"UI overview","text":""},{"location":"projects/Identinator/#usb-devices-tab","title":"\"USB Devices\" tab","text":"<p>The primary view of the tool.

Create the directory structure <code>d:\\symbols\\mydriver.sys\\620F6CF740000\\</code> with PowerShell:</p> <pre><code>New-Item -Type Directory -Path \"d:\\symbols\\mydriver.sys\\620F6CF740000\\\"\n</code></pre> <p>Put the driver binary file <code>mydriver.sys</code> in this directory.</p> <p>Now we'll determine the location where the debugger will expect the PDB. We can get this information with the <code>symchk</code> tool (included in the Windows Driver SDK, typical location: <code>C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\Debuggers\\x64</code>) in PowerShell:</p> <pre><code>[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('_NT_SYMBOL_PATH','cache*D:\\symbols;srv*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols')\nsymchk /v /os \"D:\\symbols\\mydriver.sys\\620F6CF740000\\mydriver.sys\"\n</code></pre> <p>Look for the first occurrence of this line:</p> <pre><code>SYMSRV:  UNC: D:\\symbols\\mydriver.pdb\\BBFF36A8FA374D1DAD904AD5AFDD8B441\\mydriver.pdb - file not found\n</code></pre> <p>Yet again back in PowerShell, create this directory structure:</p> <pre><code>New-Item -Type Directory -Path \"D:\\symbols\\mydriver.pdb\\BBFF36A8FA374D1DAD904AD5AFDD8B441\\\"\n</code></pre> <p>Finally, place the PDB file in this directory.</p> <p>If you now run the <code>symchk</code> command again, the output should have changed to:</p> <pre><code>SYMSRV:  PATH: D:\\symbols\\mydriver.pdb\\BBFF36A8FA374D1DAD904AD5AFDD8B441\\mydriver.pdb\nSYMSRV:  RESULT: 0x00000000\n</code></pre> <p>Watch out for mismatched pdb</p> <p>If you also get a line similar to <pre><code>DBGHELP: D:\\symbols\\mydriver.pdb\\BBFF36A8FA374D1DAD904AD5AFDD8B441\\mydriver.pdb - mismatched pdb\n</code></pre> the PDB file used is the wrong version, most probably from a newer or older build and must be replaced with the correct one!</p> <p>Finally back in WinDbg we can invoke another symbol loading:</p> <pre><code>.reload /n /f\n</code></pre> <p>After these steps, the items in the call stack should be resolved to proper function names:</p> <pre><code>9: kd&gt; kc\n # Call Site\n00 nt!KeBugCheckEx\n01
